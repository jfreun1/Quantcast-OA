# Quantcast-OA
Most Active Cookie

## Installation

## Usage

1.  Make sure any test.csv is placed into the Test Files folder located in the src directory.
2.  CD into the src. directory
3.  javac MostActiveCookies.java
4.  Run file with the following command structure: java MostActiveCookie -f FILENAME.csv -d DATE

For Example:

```bash
javac MostActiveCookie.java
```

```bash
java MostActiveCookie -f defaultTest.csv -d 2018-12-08
``'

```bash
pip install foobar
```
    

## The Challenge

Write a command line program in your preferred language to process the log file and return the most active cookie for specified day. The example below shows how we'll execute your program.

## The Assumptions

● You're only allowed to use additional libraries for testing, logging and cli-parsing. There are libraries for most languages which make this too easy (e.g pandas) and we’d like you to show off you coding skills.

● You can assume -d parameter takes date in UTC time zone.

● You have enough memory to store the contents of the whole file.

● Cookies in the log file are sorted by timestamp (most recent occurrence is first line of the file).

## The Solution
