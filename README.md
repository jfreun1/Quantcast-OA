## The Challenge

Write a command line program in your preferred language to process the log file and return the most active cookie for specified day. The example below shows how we'll execute your program.

## The Assumptions

● You can assume -d parameter takes date in UTC time zone.
● You have enough memory to store the contents of the whole file.
● Cookies in the log file are sorted by timestamp (most recent occurrence is first line of the file).
